Added

Changed game rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Characters can no longer be revived right away after being killed.
- Characters can no longer be revived on a target cell â€”
  this is now only possible on the cell where they died.
- Characters now have a bomb count (0, 1 or 2). Dropping a bomb costs one bomb.
  The bomb count of all characters is increased by 1 every 10 turns (cannot exceed 2).
  The bomb count initial value is 1.
- Walls have been removed, as they were equivalent to an absence of cell.
- The game state format is now the same in ``DO_INIT_ACK`` and ``DO_TURN_ACK``.

Fixed
~~~~~

- Only one character was allowed per player.
