Game description
================

hexabomb is a network multi-agent (multi-player) game, intended to be played by bots.
The game is strongly inspired by Bomberman and Splatoon, with hexagons.

Each agent controls characters that move on a board.
A color is associated to each agent.
The goal of each agent is to have the largest numbers of cell of its color in the board.

For this purpose, the characters color the cells they go through.
Additionally, the characters may drop bombs that color surrounding cells when they explode.

Board
-----

The game board is an hexagonal grid composed of cells.

A cell can have up to 6 neighbors (three axes, two directions per axis).
Each cell is identified by its axial coordinates :math:`(q,r)`.
This coordinate system makes sure that different cells have different coordinates,
and that going into a given direction always results in the same coordinate transformations.

Cells
-----
Two types of cells exist on the board: **usual cells** and **walls**.

Usual cells can host characters and bombs, and have a color (that can be neutral).
Players can move into usual cells if they are empty â€” i.e., if they do not host characters nor bombs.
Usual cells can be colored by a bomb if they are in the bomb's explosion range.

Contrary to usual cells, walls are obstacles without color.
Characters cannot move into walls.
Bombs cannot traverse walls.
Thin bomb explosions are completely stopped by walls,
while fat bomb explosions can circumvent them.

Objective and score
-------------------
At the end of the game, the agent with the highest score wins the game.

The score of each agent is the cumulated number of cells it controlled throughout the turns.
In other words, at the end of each turn, the score of each player is increased by the number of
cells of the player's color.

As an example, consider the following 5-cell board on which 2 players (Blue and Green) play.
At the beginning, Blue and Green control the same number of cells (1) and have the same score (1).

On first turn, Blue moves while Green does not.
This allows Blue to earn 2 points this turn, while Green only earns 1 point.

Green remains motionless in the next turns, while Blue controls more and more cells.
As a result, Blue's score increases way more than Green's.
